# PSOBB-Quests-Sweepup
Sweep-Up Operation quests for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst. These quests intend to fill in gaps where select enemies are missing from Mop-up style quests, notably enemies in Episode 1 that are floor restricted (Hildebears, Slimes, Bringers, Gunners). Some of these quests make use of rooms with multiple active spawn waves. These quests do not contain increases for the quest timers, nor do they ever pause your movement while playing.

The quests were designed entirely in Qedit but are in this repository as broken up files. Each quest was split into the .pasm and .dat components through Sodaboy's quest_disasm tool located [on the Ephinea forums](https://www.pioneer2.net/community/threads/psobb-quest-assembler-disassembler-source.1728/). The quest_disasm tool also produces a .dat file, which is a list of tables defining the Objects, NPCs, and Wave events for a quest. The .dat file was split into those separate, human readable text files using a processing tool that allows converting the .dat file into a list of human readable files and back. This tool will be linked here when it's available and ready on Github.

The quest script is the .pasm file in each directory. These quests have pseudo comments in the form of **message** opcodes where the message has *\*\** at the start of the text argument.
