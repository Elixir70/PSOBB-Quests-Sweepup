# PSOBB-Quests-SweepUp
Sweep-Up Operation quests for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst. Intended to fill in some gaps where select enemies are missing from Mop-up style quests, such as other floor numbers in Episode 1 and the entirety of Episode 2. 

The decrompressed .pasm and .dat files are uploaded here as code. The releases page contains the full compressed quests that can be used on a server.

The .dat files are currently binary files but will eventually be converted into a human-readable format using a processor.
