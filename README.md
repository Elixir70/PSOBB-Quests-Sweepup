# PSOBB-Quests-Sweepup
Sweep-Up Operation quests for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst. These quests intend to fill in gaps where select enemies are missing from Mop-up style quests, notably enemies in Episode 1 that are floor restricted (Hildebears, Slimes, Bringers, Gunners). Some of these quests make use of rooms with multiple active spawn waves. These quests do not contain increases for the quest timers, nor do they ever pause your movement while playing.

The decrompressed .pasm and .dat files are uploaded here as code. The releases page contains the full compressed quests that can be used on a server.

The .dat files are currently binary files but will eventually be converted into a human-readable format using a processor.
